            Founded in 2025, saw seven workmates establish this shop called I'm
            Just a Crepe, created primarily for the only purpose of making
            Science High School students say, "Oh Wow! So yummy!" Sweet and
            savory creeps are sold, lavished with love. And adorably cat-shaped
            ice creams licked and savored to their full.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is sheer love for these entirely original, cute, and
            kind-to-the-pocket snacks that bring joy to taste buds and hearts.
            Everywhere is made using nothing but the best of raw materials to
            guarantee freshness and great flavor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our hope is for this stall to be a-journey's-end for every single
            student wishing to pamper their palate whenever break time rolls
            around for some sweet treats. Mostly fun- with-cheap, instagrammable
            food-the students and faculty are the target market.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope to merge creativity, teamwork, and foodie passion to make
            I'm Just a Crepe a big part of any school event. Every bite will be
            a representation of joy, thrill, and a longing to return for more!
            And on every turn, we wish to engage in creating not just a snack,
            but an experience-full of sweetness with every product we offer.

            Our mission is to provide students with cold, refreshing ice cream
